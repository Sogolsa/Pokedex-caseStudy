            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Pokédex app is a web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and
                enables
                the viewing of data points in detail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_item">
            <h3>Purpose and Context:</h3>
            <p>This case study has been done as a personal project for Career Foundry web development program, to
                showcase
                how I
                created the architecture of a JavaScript app, and how I test and debug the code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_item">
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The aim of the project was to build a web app so that users can view a list of data loaded from an
                external
                source (API) and see more details about a data item in a modal by clicking on them. I have focused on
                the
                core
                principles of JavaScript like objects, arrays, conditionals, loops and functions, ensuring that the app
                is
                working in all necessary browsers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_item">
            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>It took me about 10 to 12 days to finish this project. I was able to finish it before the deadline.</p>

            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>In the development of the Pokémon JavaScript app, my role primarily focused on frontend development and
                API
                integration. I was responsible for designing and implementing the user interface using HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript.

        <p class="middle1">I created a Pokémon JavaScript app that would allow users to explore an arranged list of
            their
            favorite
            Pokémon.
            My goal was to fetch data dynamically from the Pokémon API, presenting it in an engaging and user-friendly
            interface.</p>
        <h3>Step 1: IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)</h3>
        <p>To ensure a clean structure, I employed the IIFE pattern to allow me to create a module to prevent any
            potential conflicts of variable names between libraries and programs and provide a clear separation of
            concerns.
            This step lays the foundation for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Fetching Pokémon Data</h3>
        <p>With the structural framework in place, the next logical step was to fetch Pokémon data from the official
            Pokémon API. I limited the initial fetch to the first 150 Pokémon as original Pokémon series. I used fetch
            for making asynchronous HTTP requests.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Asynchronous JavaScript with Promises</h3>
        <p>I incorporated promises into the data fetching process for a readable asynchronous code flow. The loadList
            function built with promises, ensures a smooth transition from initiating the data fetch to handling the
            received JSON data.</p>

        <h3 class="middle2">Step 4: Enhancing Pokémon Details</h3>
        <p>With loadDetails function I extended the app to fetch detailed information of Pokémon images, heights, and
            types, to enhance the user experience.</p>
        <h3>Step 5: Dynamic Modal for Pokémon Details</h3>
        <p>To provide a clean way to display additional information, I added a dynamic modal that shows the Pokémon
            information including their names, type, height, image, when clicked by a button. And the user can hide the
            modal when the information is not needed.</p>
        <h3>Step 6: Crafting the User Interface</h3>
        <p>At this stage I utilized Bootstrap to build a visually appealing design, and have a responsive and
            mobile-friendly app.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/error-handling.jpg" class="img3">
        <h3 class="middle3">Step 7: Error Handling and User Feedback</h3>
        <p>I implemented error handling to manage any issues during data retrieval, debugging, providing informative
            error messages to the user and make the code easier to maintain and update.</p>

        <h3 class="middle4">Meeting The Objective</h3>
        <p>The initial goal was to create a Pokémon JavaScript app that dynamically fetched data from the Pokémon API,
            offering users exploration of their favorite Pokémon's. Looking back, the result met this objective. The app
            shows a seamless interface providing users with nostalgic experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            Pokedex App was my first JavaScript project. Understanding how JavaScript interacts with the DOM to
            manipulate HTML elements was something that I had to get used to.
        <p>Something that specifically I encounter in this project involved implementing the modal. Each time I opened
            the modal, the image was missing. I added some console logs and error handling to find where I had made
            mistakes on my code. I had no errors showing on my console but still the image was missing. At the end I
            realized that I had a small typo on my code. And the problem was solved.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout the development of Pokémon app, I gained confidence in my problem-solving skills and in my ability
            to apply JavaScript
            concepts into a real-world project. I was very satisfied with the result and ready to handle more
            complex development projects.
        </p>

        </p>
        <img src="img/loading-future.jpg" class="img5">
        <h3 class="img5-text">Future</h3>
        <p>
            In the future, I would add loading indicators while loading data. And I would enhance error handling, to
            show user-friendly error messages. Or I would add more detailed information about each Pokémon and expand
            the app's features such as adding search functionality.
            Overall, the Pokémon app project was a rewarding journey that not only met its objectives, but also provided
            valuable insights into effective web development practices.
